                The Climate Change Advisor, also known as the Post-Climate Change Survival Advisor, envisions a world deeply affected by climate change. Acting as a digital survival advisor from the future, it provides users with scenario-based guidance, survival strategies, and location-specific advice. This project raises awareness about the consequences of climate change while showcasing the potential of advanced AI to address global challenges.

            <p>
                The chatbot allows users to explore scenarios such as rising sea levels, prolonged droughts, and extreme weather events. Through interactive conversations, it offers educational insights, survival tips, and scenario-specific advice, encouraging proactive thought and environmental action.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speculative design plays a key role in this project, creating a narrative that combines real-world data and futuristic storytelling. By immersing users in a climate-changed future, the chatbot inspires reflection on current practices and collective solutions to mitigate future environmental disasters.
